<p>
    Attempts were made as early as 1937 by Walt Disney to adapt Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale,
     "The Snow Queen", into a film. The tale focuses on two children, one named Gerda, 
     who served as the basis for Princess Anna, and the other named Kai, who is "cursed with negativity" 
     after his eyes are pierced with shards of glass from an enchanted mirror and is later kidnapped by the Snow

<p>Eva Bella and Spencer Ganus were cast to portray Elsa as a young child and as a teenager,
     respectively.[18][19] Actress and singer Megan Mullally was originally cast to voice an adult Elsa,
     but was replaced by Idina Menzel. Menzel already knew Kristen Bell,[21] who voiced Anna, and had previously 
     auditioned for a lead role in the 2010 Disney film Tangled.[22] She was not cast for the part, but the casting director recorded her 
     singing and later showed the recording to Frozen's film executives.[22] Menzel was surprised when she was subsequently asked to audition,
     and she received the role after reading the script out loud.[21] In interviews, she acknowledged similarities between Elsa, her then-current role, 
     and Elphaba, her previous role.
    Namely, she said, they were both very powerful and very misunderstood individuals.</p>

        Following the casting of Idina Menzel, Elsa's characterization underwent several alterations. 
        According to Menzel, she was originally scripted as a one-dimensional antagonist 
        but was gradually revised as a more vulnerable, multifaceted figure.
        Menzel further described her character as "extremely complicated and misunderstood".
        Director Jennifer Lee stated that Elsa is largely driven by fear throughout the film,
         while Menzel added that she was also struggling with her potential to be "a strong, powerful, extraordinary woman".
          Executive producer and animator John Lasseter became very "protective of Elsa" and was adamant about portraying her in a more favorable, sympathetic light.[35] Writer and director Jennifer Lee stated on Twitter that Elsa's body language and mannerisms were "intentional to show anxiety and depression".[36] In July 2013, 
         Disney released images of the film's main characters along with outlines of their roles in the story.

    <p>The Sami language version was announced as a special dubbing chosen for the inspiration the second movie took from the Sami culture.
        A major challenge was to find sopranos capable of matching Menzel's warm vocal tone and vocal range in their native languages.
        Rick Dempsey, senior executive at Disney Character Voices International regarded the process as "exceptionally challenging", explaining, 
        "It's a difficult juggling act to get the right intent of the lyrics and also have it match rhythmically to the music. And then you have to go back and adjust for lip sync! 
        [It]... requires a lot of patience and precision."[64] Just like Idina Menzel, four of Elsa's dubbers also played the role of Elphaba in Wicked, that is: Maria Lucia Rosenberg (Danish),[65] Willemijn Verkaik (Dutch and German),
         Mona Mor (Hebrew) and Hyena Park [ko] (Korean).[68][69] Serena Autieri, along with the whole Italian version of Frozen,
         was awarded best foreign dubbing worldwide.</p>
